# FIXME

Here are some corner cases with unclear solution.

If you have any ideas / suggestions on how to fix them, feel free to submit a PR.

For example.

- what to do with impossible routes?
- how can we enable optimization of routes?
- how can we enable multilayer routing using different metal levels

We follow the priorities [naming convention](https://piousbox.com/2019/06/definition-of-priority-codes-p0-p1-p2-p3-p4-in-technical-development/)

- P0 – the work stops, site is down
- P1 – unblock someone else, required to be done before other things
- P2 – ordinary flow of work
- P3 – nice to have, but not required
- P4 – informational only
